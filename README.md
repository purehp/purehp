## Future improvements

- PIndexer / PArrayIndexer
  Just the PIndexer should be enough, but since there was a problem with matching with indexers and accessors, I decided to create the new data structure. Improve when possible.
  Moreover, an extra set of parentheses is being added right now. E.g. `($this->scope['something'])->foo(1)`;
